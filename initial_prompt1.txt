>  I'm looking to build a skincare AI assistant 
   chatbot-like app. High level idea @Initial_Plan.txt 

   Similar skincare AI assistant app implementation

   Use web search tool to read this blog.

   this is what the other skincase AI assistant app 
   implementation blog has written:
   <START>
    Most skincare apps just throw products at you without really understanding what works together. We wanted to do something different with Glowe, so we built a system that actually knows how skincare routines work in the real world.

    For this, we started with a healthy dataset of around 1,440 curated Korean skincare products and over 94,500 user reviews. But unlike most recommendation systems that treat products and reviews as separate, isolated pieces, we looked at the bigger picture of how products would work together in real user routines. Because let’s be honest: your morning routine can’t also be your evening routine, and some ingredients just don’t get along.

    So, we ran every review through an LLM (Gemma 3 12B) to pull out the real effects, good and bad, that people experienced based on the review's text. The result? Enhanced reviews that show what works (and what doesn’t):

    {
    "text": "Helped calm my redness and hydrate my skin, though I broke out a little at first.",
    "positive_effects": ["Reduced redness", "Hydration"],
    "negative_effects": ["Initial breakouts"]
    }

    This way, we're not just guessing or using marketing-tailored descriptions; we actually know what each product actually does based on real experiences.

   I have this database - with skincase products and their
    reviews @sephora_select_reviews.db 


   Please go through the database tables - number of 
   products, number of reviews, look at few samples of 
   product rows, reviews few rows (20 to 30 rows for 
   example) to get an idea of the data. 

   Then design how I can do similar step with my data. 
   what information can I pull out from the reviews . 
   pulling out good number of information from the reviews
    will be helpful - for giving good recommendation to 
   the user for their personalised case.
   the user will be asking for one kind of product - like 
   moisturiser (or) sunscreen (or) toner - during the chat
    stage.

   Please go through this blog and their implementation 
   https://weaviate.io/blog/glowe-app

   We could be collecting from the user information 
   something like this:
   user_information = {
       "goals": {
           "firmer_skin": False,
           "hydrate": False,
           "glow_up": False,
           "repair_renew": False,
           "soothe_relax": False,
           "protect": False
       },
       "conditions": {
           "acne": False,
           "clogged_pores": False,
           "redness": True,
           "wrinkles": True,
           "pigmentation": True,
           "rough_texture": False
       },
       "skin_type": 67,  # if <33: 'Dry'; elif >66: 
   'Oily'; else: 'Normal'
       "sensitive_skin": False,
       "age": 30,
       "additional_concerns": "My skin doesn't work well 
   with retinol"
   }


   Please give Design plan of how we can extract suitable 
   relevant information from the user reviews (positive 
   effects, negative effects, product using experience, 
   any other relavant information from the reviews), how we can do 
   embedding, TF-IDF, etc - maybe update the product data 
   (maybe a new table), maybe another embedding, and how 
   to use this information to give personalised 
   recommendation to the user for their skincase 
   requirement / case. 

   Please create a detailed Design plan (similar to the 
   blog) in markdown  format. Please create suitable 
   design / architecture diagrams using Nano Banana Pro 
   MCP server, and save to this project folder itself. 
   Explain clearly about the extraction step 
   from the reviews (extracting things like positive 
   effects etc, what are some things we can extract) - how
    to go about implementing this.

   Don't implement code. Only create a detailed design 
   plan . Ask any clarifying questions. Use perplexity MCP
    server if necessary.
