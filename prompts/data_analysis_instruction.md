 We would like to first understand the data in the 
 database. 
 And possibly try to reduce the data which is 
 outside Skincase. 
 
 Please go through the database / tables. 
 
 Give entire list of primary_category, 
 secondary_category and tertiary_category hierarchy. 
 
 See how many reviews are there, without a product 
 associated with it. 
 
 See how many products are there for whom less than 
 10 reviews are present. 
 
 for the reviews, give number of reviews for whom 
 number of words in the reviews are less than 10 
 words. 
 
 Write all the findings in a new markdown file.
